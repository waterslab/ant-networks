# ant-networks
Materials associated with a study investigating the scaling of social interaction networks in ant colonies.

The animations folder contains a set of movies visualizing the spatial trajectories and social networks that develop over time based on interactions, based on real-world ant colonies and the results of our simulation model.

The data folder contains all of the raw data referenced in our study, both the social network edge lists for the ten Pogonomyrmex californicus interaction networks (as determined by watching video of the colonies and manually recording each direct antennal contact between workers), and the simulation results (interactions and spatial coordinates for groups ranging in size 10-300+ individuals). 

Also available is the R code for our simulation model: AntSim-01-function.R and AntSim-02-simulation-loop.R.
